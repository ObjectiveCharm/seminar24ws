# About
The repository mirror of Seminar Computer Networking & Internet (INHN4003) from lrz gitlab.

The CI infrastcutures is not included, for that is in another repository.

# Afterwords
I know that I just flooded a very sketchy primitive piece of sh*t and dare to call it a "seminar paper" and even make this trash out of my shamelessness and stupidity.

But I have nothing more that can fill my poor CV, at least it shows that I have very basic python and LaTeX knowledge.

What a shame
